# DCGAN-Keras

This is a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network built in Keras. Given a dataset of images it will be able 
to generate new images similar to those in the dataset. It was originally built to generate landscape paintings such 
as the ones shown below. As a result, also contained are some scripts for collecting artwork from ArtUK and resizing 
images to make them work with the network.
